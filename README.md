# Bloc-Mod-1-1
Bloc Module 1 Welcome to Bloc first assignment
This is a test line.
Day 2: Per the instructions on the first assignment, "Frontend Foundations", I am including a link to my Report Card on the Code School site. The url is: https://www.codeschool.com/users/drb0779. I have no questions or concerns. I have done the basic courses on Codecademy and more indepth courses at W3Schools on HTML and CSS. Code School was a good refresher, especially on forms.
